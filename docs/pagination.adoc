Pagination
==========

//==========

A +Pagination+ instance represents a sequence of numbered links. Intermediate
ranges are hidden from view. The active link is controlled by setting the
instance's <<active>> property.


Constructor
-----------
[source,js]
new Pagination(element, options);

Initialise a new Pagination instance.

element::
	__(Element)__
	Reference to a DOM element. Stored in the instance's <<el,.el>> property.

options::
	__(Object)__
	Optional dictionary of link:options.adoc[options].



Methods
-------

=== rebuild ( )
Refresh the display of the pagination links with the current settings.

This method should be called if the +activeLength+, +startLength+ or +endLength+
properties are modified after the instance is created. It's already called when
setting the <<active>> or <<length>> properties.



Properties
----------
Most of these properties (except for <<el>>) are copied from the
link:options.adoc[options hash] when the instance is created.

=== active
Zero-based index of the currently-selected link.

Setting this property will trigger the
link:options.adoc#onchange[onChange] callback (if specified).
Should the callback return an explicit value of +false+, the assignment is
aborted, and no change will be made to the property.


=== activeLength
Number of links to display before and after the selected link.


=== clipTemplate
The blueprint for generating truncation indicators


=== endLength
The number of links to display at the end of the pagination trail.


=== el
A reference to the DOM element that was passed to the constructor.


=== length
Total number of pages that can be traversed using this instance.


=== linkTemplate
The blueprint used to generate new page links. How it's used depends on type:

**Element:**
If given a reference to an element, it's detached from the DOM and deep-cloned
whenever a new link is created. The deepest node inside the element is used for
displaying the link's index:
[source,html]
-------------
<li class="template">
	<a href="#">
		Â»
		<span> %REPLACED% </span>
	</a>
</li>
-------------

**Function:**
A callback can be used to return a new HTMLElement.
Functions are called with two parameters: the page link's index, and a reference
to the relevant +Pagination+ instance.

**String:**
Strings are parsed as HTML blocks. As with element references, the deepest node
inside the parsed block is used for displaying the link's index.


=== onChange
Callback triggered whenever the instance's <<active>> property is changed.
The callback is passed two arguments: the new value about to be set, and
the previous value.

If the function returns +false+, the assignment is cancelled.


=== startLength
The number of links to display at the start of the pagination trail.
